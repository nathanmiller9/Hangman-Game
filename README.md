Description on how to use the app

Requirements

The specifications for the Hangman Game assignment were:
to create a hangman game that had a theme
Use key events to listen for the letters that your players will type.
Display the following on the page:
Press any key to get started!
Wins: (# of times user guessed the word correctly).
If the word is madonna, display it like this when the game starts: _ _ _ _ _ _ _.
As the user guesses the correct letters, reveal them: m a d o _  _ a.
Number of Guesses Remaining: (# of guesses remaining for the user).
Letters Already Guessed: (Letters the user has guessed, displayed like L Z Y H).
After the user wins/loses the game should automatically choose another word and make the user play it.

Technologies used in this assignment were:

HTML
CSS/Bootstrap
JavaScript

I learned a lot in this project especially involving how to work with JavaScript
but also getting further experience with CSS/Bootstrap and HTML.  In JS, learned a lot 
about for loops, conditional statements, objects, methods, functions, and user interaction.
Perhaps, most of all, through this assignment, I learned that I have a LOT more to learn.
